# Elucidate #

A Visual Studio extension that allows you to comment code using MarkDown, resulting in code that is interleaved with rich text, pictures and hyperlinks.

Elucidate was inspired by Donald Knuth's *literate programming*. Although it falls short of that ideal, the ability to anotate code with references and pictures aids in a better understanding of the code at hand. From my experience external code documentation is rarely created and consulted even less. The best place to document code is in the code. Unfortunately traditional comments falls short of allowing programmers to elaborate on the design. Sometimes a simple picture says a thousand words. The ability to link to other parts of the documentation is also key. As programmers we spend much more time reading code, than writing code. We should make this activity as effortless as possible for our fellow programmers.
